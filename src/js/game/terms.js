This particular mutation can render a person dysfunctional if they do not learn how to control the visual stimuli the mutation causes.  It is rare that a person with apophenism survives with both eyes intact.  Most of the time they remove their own eyes to save their sanity.  Most aphens have the ability to create things from nothing.',
