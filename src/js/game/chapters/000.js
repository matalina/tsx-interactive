# The Search for X

It is the 3121 and Earth is overpopulated.  78 billion people and growing live on the dead rock that is now Earth.  The ice caps have melted and the water that remains is polluted.  Only a giant city remains across the planet.  The governments of the twenty-first century have fallen replaced by six mega-corporations that control all aspects of life including births and deaths.  

Life begin and end at prestige rating of zero. It is a constant race to see who is better, or worse, and who is ultimately worthy of surviving until a ripe old age.

A recent leak from Allied Corporation, the oldest and strongest of the megacorps, reveals they are searching for something referred to as 'X'.  You are one of the first few to learn of this development.
