# Prologue

It’s like any other day, except you wake to the hateful drone of an Allied Corp jingle.  _Allied Corps way_ followed by a few cacophonous notes to close out the commercial that pierced through your dreams. Mouse, your faithful companion, or more appropriately your L539JZV-M0U53 Pocket Quantum Computer in gun metal black, spoke softly in your ear. “Nix, an urgent message from Reaper.”

You groan as your roll out of bed. “What does she want now?”

Mouse responded by playing the voice message she’d taken while you’d been asleep. A soft voice echoed in your inner ear. “Nix, Did you fucking see. Allied Corp has an epic bounty. I want in, but I need your help. Call the fuck back.” What should have sounded like a sweet innocent girl was filled with vulgarities and a harshness that made you shiver. Reaper was just a kid, but Reaper was powerful. Turning Reaper away wasn't something you wanted to do lightly.

But what was this bounty? Should you take the risk? Was it worth it? Look around or ask Mouse if she can help you out.
